# married

A simple time ticker to count how long have I been married, so when things are getting hard, I can look back and see how far we have gotten together. I want to show people that the husband and wife of a certain household **can** have a longlasting emotional affection, which will have a positive impact on their children.

I want to build a harmonious family. A family, no matter where they live, they will always call it home, because a home is not the place itself. It is the people. In the future, I want me, my wife, and _our_ children to always have a place to come back **home** and feel safe inside.
